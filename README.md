This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in R related to data frame subsetting using logical indexing. The `bug.r` file contains code that produces an unexpected empty data frame when attempting to subset based on a condition involving multiple columns. The `bugSolution.r` file offers corrected versions using the `with()` function and the `subset()` function, illustrating how to avoid this issue. The problem arises because of how R handles logical vector recycling during subsetting; this can lead to unintended results when dealing with multiple conditions within the indexing operation.  The solution demonstrates safer and more reliable methods to accomplish the intended data subsetting.
